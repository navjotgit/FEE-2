            <p><strong>Author:</strong> George Orwell</p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong>George Orwell’s dystopian novel <i>1984</i> is a chilling depiction of a totalitarian regime where the government controls every aspect of life. The book explores themes of surveillance, censorship, and individualism in a world where Big Brother is always watching. It's a thought-provoking read that remains relevant today.</p>

            <h2>Review: To Kill a Mockingbird</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Harper Lee</p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong>Set in the American South during the 1930s, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> is a powerful narrative about race, justice, and morality. Through the eyes of young Scout Finch, we witness the trial of a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Harper Lee’s novel is both a poignant coming-of-age story and a scathing critique of racial injustice.</p>
